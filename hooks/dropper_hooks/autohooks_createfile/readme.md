Sanbox where I've been developing the hooks and the executable thats going to be under test to prove the hooking functionalities. 
This was uploaded just to show how it works all in a single file that autohooks itself.

**Important ** 
There is a .h named globals where I define global locations of the files you should adequate the paths and compile the file in order to properly work.
